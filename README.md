# BackPack

Basic template to create PHP packages.

## Features

- Composer default json file

- Default src & tests folder created
- Default PSR-4 namespace

If you think about anything else that could be added to create a complete template for package bootstrap, feel free to submit a PR on the develop branch.

## Installer
